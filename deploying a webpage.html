        <h2>My personal background</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Western Massachusetts and Southern Vermont. When time came around for college, I applied to mostly New England universities and two in New York. Eventually, I ended up at Simmons University on track to be a physical therapist. I graduated with an exercise science degree, but ultimately didn't feel that was the right path for me. I then got my Associate's in Graphic Design at a community college and decided I wanted to expand beyond that, thus leading me to the Harvard Extension School.</p>
        <h2>My coding background</h2>
        <p>Fall 2023 was my first semester enrolled at the Extension School and my first class was Fundamentals of Web Development. Prior to this, I had no knowledge at all of any languages (HTML, CSS, Java, etc). At the end of the semester, I was able to incorporate HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make a website. I am far from a pro, but I would say I have a good foundation of the languages. One of my favorite aspects of the final project of creating a website was researching how to make my website unique and learning about how to add the different components. I would say that my skillset in Javascript is the most rusty, but I am mildly comfortable with HTML and CSS. I would love to use the skills I've learned to create single web page applications!</p>
        <h2>My favorites</h2>
        <p>Nothing beats the tranquility of Vermont summers.</p>
